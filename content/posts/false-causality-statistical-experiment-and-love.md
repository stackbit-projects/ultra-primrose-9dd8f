  People tends to forget about existence of a third variable when concluding
  causality between two events.

# Brief intro to Statistical Fallacies  

So, what are Statistical Fallacies?
> "Misuse of Statistics: Using numbers in such a manner that – either by intent or through ignorance or carelessness – the conclusions are unjustified or incorrect.  
<cite>Spirer, Spirer & Jaffe 1998, p. 1.</cite>

So data can be easily manipulated or misunderstood to tell a different story from the truth. This post will tackle one of the most common forms of Statistical Fallacies, with the name **False Causality**

# Background
As an avid manga(Japanese comics) reader, I stumble in 1 book that introduces me to the world of statistical experimentation. No, I'm not talking about Manga Guide to Statistics, I'm talking about "Science Fell in Love, So I Tried to Prove It"

Hey hey hey, don't get me wrong. I'm not doing manga reviews on my blog, but I want to share what I learned from this manga.

# So What’s the story?
This is a story about two post-graduate researchers, Shinya and Himuro, who fell in love with each other. With their scientific-pride, they tried to gather evidence to prove their love.
To make things easier to remember, I will call Shinya(the male MC) as **James** and Himuro(the female MC) as **Mary**

# The first experiment

The first way they try to prove their love is by measuring their heart-rat. 
The hypothesis is “My heartbeat will increase when I’m standing near someone I love”. Now I will create the causal graph from that statement. A causal graph is a graph where the vertex(the circle) represents an event and the edge(the arrow) represents which event will cause another event to happen. Let assume the causal graph like this :

<cite>This graph represents 2 events, which are “standing with the loved one” and “increasing heartbeat”. The arrow show that the left event will cause the right event<</cite>
